Title: About Me
Date: 2019-10-22 10:50

Since childhood, I have been very interested in problem solving and maths. At 15 years old, I tested Linux for the first time and was overwhelmed by the customization options and freedom it had. This led to me growing up to be quite passionate about [free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

After high school, I ended up in Tampere to study Information and Knowledge Management to Tampere University of Techonology (now part of Tampere University). More about the program in Finnish on [Tuni's program guide on Information and Knowledge Management](https://www.tuni.fi/fi/tule-opiskelemaan/tietojohtaminen-teknis-taloudellinen-koulutus). I am finishing my studies in Winter 2020.

In the university, I got very interested in data science and machine learning. I have developed my skills on university classes and in my work at [Seravo](https://seravo.com).
